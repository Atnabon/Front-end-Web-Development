## Responsive Web Design
I had started to learn web development in this awesome website in 2019 but I was not consistent enough to proceed with it. I had resumed with the course on 1st September 2021 and now I am done with the [Responsive Web Design module](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). I got to do 5 projects and earned my first [certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/betascribbles/responsive-web-design) from there. This repo contains the projects I did in my Responsive Web Design learning journey
